# Computer Vision and Image Processing
1. OpenCV Tutorial, Image Rotation: Here, a blank image is created. Then, it is filled by two rectangles using *rectangle* function. Next, the image is interactively rotated by changing the angle of rotation with a trackBar created by *createTrackbar*. Functions *getRotationMatrix2D* and *warpAffine* are used to implement the rotation around the center of the image.
